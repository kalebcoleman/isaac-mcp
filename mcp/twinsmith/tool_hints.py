"""MCP hints for catalogued tools that have no versioned contract: bridge built-ins and the work cell.

The generic pack's hints are in ``server.py``, next to its contract list. These are advisory, not
enforcement, and a test requires an entry for every catalogued tool. Bridge tools from a project's
own extension are not listed here and carry no hints.
