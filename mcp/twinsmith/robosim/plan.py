    ratio (using the exponent seen so far, since displacement is not exactly proportional to travel) and
    turns it by the measured direction error. A trial that did not move re-aims a straight push through the
    pivot along the clip's direction. ``pivot`` is the object's start xy; an ``evaluate`` result's ``pivot`` replaces
    it. Stops at the first trial within tolerance, else after ``max_trials``. Returns ``(trials, best, stopped_because)``; every trial row keeps ``push`` and the evaluate extras.
