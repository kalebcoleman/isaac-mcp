# Third-party notices

This repository ships **no assets**. The work cell is designed to use the third-party assets
below, which each user keeps in packs in their local asset root (see `docs/ASSET-PACKS.md`; each
pack's `pack.yaml` records the source and licence of every file). Older revisions of the repository
carried them; these notices apply to anyone who obtains or redistributes them.
NVIDIA Isaac Sim assets and the Vention workstation are **not** redistributed;
they come from their official source or are supplied by the operator.

Changes: the URDF/xacro sources were converted to USD with the Isaac Sim URDF
importer; visuals and colliders were reparented under the links; the
Quick-Changer was converted and reoriented for the flange mount. The files in
`adapter_ref/` are unmodified copies.

The FMB project releases its CAD and data under the Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International License:

Changes: the object CAD was converted to USD; materials, colliders and physics
overlays were authored; some objects were renamed, rescaled or repositioned for
the UR5e workcell; ArUco poses were added. The `doc` metadata that named the
original workstation path was removed.

## Generated ArUco markers

`<asset-folder>/<pack>/objects/aruco/` contains marker images generated from the
standard OpenCV 4x4 and 5x5 ArUco dictionaries, plus pose JSON produced by the
twin's tooling. OpenCV is Apache-2.0; the generated dictionary patterns are not
copyrightable.

## Assets that are not redistributed

- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** — the UR5e robot, RealSense D455 model and NVIDIA
  material libraries remain under the NVIDIA Isaac Sim Additional Software and
  Materials License. The simulator's own asset root supplies them by name; the
  repository does not download or ship them.
- **Vention workstation** — the Vention MachineBuilder export is not
  redistributed. An operator may supply their own copy in the asset cache; the
  twin otherwise builds a simple placeholder bench.
- **Poliigon** — the `WoodVeneerOak_7760` textures were removed. Their licence
  does not permit embedding them in a redistributed scene.
